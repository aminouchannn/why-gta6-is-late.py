# AmirBot Simulator – The Most Predictable Human NPC Ever


This repo contains two things:

1. A **hilarious Python simulator** that perfectly recreates your friend Amir's Discord behavior  
2. A **real Discord bot** version that literally acts exactly like him (for science... and maximum tilt)

Because let's be honest:  
Amir is more predictable than GTA loading screens, NPCs in San Andreas, and your grandma's WhatsApp status.

## Features (aka Amir's Greatest Hits)

- Joins voice chat instantly when his 3 same friends are there  
- Ragequits on 0.2ms ping / imaginary error in < 1 second  
- Spams the **exact same dead meme** since 2021  
- Alternates between "I'm the goat" energy and clown emoji spam  
- Ragebaits in 2–4 messages maximum  
- Comes back 4–10 minutes later like nothing happened  
- Bonus: Makes the same 3 sheep friends rejoin every time (the curse continues)
